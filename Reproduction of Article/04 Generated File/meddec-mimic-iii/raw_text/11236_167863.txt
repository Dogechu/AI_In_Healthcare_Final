Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea with fever & tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
An 82 year old [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking woman recently discharged from
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for PNA returns with 3 days of diarrhea complicated
by tachycardia and fever as measured by her daughter/VNA. This
history is obtained from the patient's daughter and review of
medical records as communication with the patient is difficult
secondary to language and hearing difficulties.
.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF RECENT HOSPITALIZATION [**Date range (1) 108333**]:
The patient presented with hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory
failure due to PNA with effusions attributed to diastolic heart
failure. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on
Levoflox/Vanc to finish a 10 day Levofloxacin only course. The
patient experienced ? AMS but head CT was negative. Patient was
continued on Lovenox for chronic DVT h/o PE. Her cr remained at
1.8-2.4 during this admission. She developed a new wound
possibly from plexipulses and required extensive wound care for
multiple wounds. She was made DNR/DNI. The patient was D/C'd
home without mention of diarrhea.
.
Per the daughter, [**Name (NI) 108329**], the patient developed diarrhea during
her recent hospitalization that has persisted since discharge.
The patient had a "tought day" with some agitation and apparent
discomfort with breathing. The patient was eating but
"everything she ate caused loose stools" different from her
regular Crohn's flares. When [**Name (NI) 108329**] noted tachycardia and fever
accompanying the loose, yellow non-bloody stools with an
increasing O2 requirement, the patient was brought into the ED
.
In the ED, VS: 99.2 BP 103/53 HR 110, RR 24, 100% on 3L. Exam
revealed crackles and decreased BS. EKG showing RBBB with old
TWI in 3, sinus tach. CXR: resolving PNA. Received Vanco 1g &
fluids in ED.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is laying in bed and
reports that she is "fine." She complains of generalized chronic
weakness and has pain during wound dressing changes. Her
daughter relayed the history as above. The patient has a cough
productive of green sputum once on arrival. She has R sided
tremor.
.
ROS:
Significant for easy bruising, long standing vision & hearing
loss,
Denies headache, cough (except for above), SOB, chest pain,
abdominal pain, hematochezia, melena

IMAGING:
[**2194-4-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. New mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.

2. Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and dense
retrocardiac opacity
which may represent left lower lobe collapse or, less likely,
consolidation.

[**2194-4-2**] UPPER EXT U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. No left upper extremity DVT.
2. Left thyroid cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
An 82 year old lady with multiple medical problems recently
discharged for PNA presents with 3 days of diarrhea accompanied
by tachycardia & fever with concern for new left pneumonia
despite levaquin therapy. Her exam and appearance is concerning
for respiratory distress.
.
1) Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a new left sided
pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity and L pleural effusion on CXR
from either new process or aspiration. On admission to the
medicine service she was found to be in hypoxic/hypercarbic
respiratory failure and was transferred to the ICU. She was
started on vancomycin/zosyn 2 week course, albuterol and
ipratropium neb treatments and supplemental oxygen. IV fluids
were administered for her acute on chronic CKD (see below) which
may have lead to some pulmonary edema. Sputum culture was done
but did not reveal the source of her pneumonia. She completed
the course and her oxygen requirements improved. Lasix was held
in the setting of her ATN thus some fluid overload may be
present, and prior to discharge she was slowly restarted on
lasix for diuresis. She remained afebrile for the length of her
admission. Prior to discharge a repeat chest xray showed a
stable left-sided pleural effusion, new small right sided
pleural effusion (thought to be secondary to holding lasix for
hypotension for over a week), and stable retrocardiac opacity.
The patient was discharged on 2.5-3L of oxygen, with
saturdations 90-93%.

.
2) Diarrhea: This may have been the cause to the patient's
volume loss, leading to hypotension and eventually to ATN. While
initially guaiaic negative, it was felt to be due to antibiotic
use, infectious or Crohn's flare. She was c.diff negative x2.
Her poor po intake began to improve and her diarrhea, while
intermittent continued to be an issue. In the setting of
thrombocytopenia she had loose guaiac positive, dark/tarry
stools. It was unclear if this was a [**Name (NI) 4522**] flare of small
bleed from anticoagulation (on heparin at the time) or
thrombocytopenia. She was started on pulse dose steroids and
tapered down to prednisone 60mg daily. She is currently on a
taper. The GI service was consulted and felt that flexible
sigmoidoscopy may help elucidate whether there is new dysplasia
or worsening of her Crohn's. The patient's daughter and HCT did
not feel her mother could tolerate a procedure at this time and
opted for medical management. It remains unclear what caused her
diarrhea but it was encouraged that she maintain a lactose-free
diet as this was felt to exacerbate the issue. She will continue
her prednisone taper while at rehabilitation. She has a
follow-up appointment with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 3708**] after discharge. Given she
has been on steroids for many years, calcium and vitamin D
therapy was initiated during this hospitalization.

.
3) Diastolic Heart Failure: Her most recent echo suggests
hyperdynamic stiff ventricle as supported by elevated BNP, EF
70-80%. However this was done in the setting of what appeared to
be septic physiology. Her lasix and metoprolol were held on
admission for hypotension and renal failure. Lasix was restarted
prior to discharge for diuresis and improve her respiratory
status. Metoprolol should be restarted when appropriate, given
she is on a prednisone taper. Prior to discharge a transthoracic
echo was performed so that it can be used for comparison in the
future. The results will be pending after discharge and should
be followed-up at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Her weight on discharge was
77.8kg.

.
4) ATN/CKD: Patient at last discharge with creatinine of 2.4.
She was felt to be pre-renal given the diarrhea, which was
likely responsible for her elevated troponin on this admission.
Her creatinine rose to peak at 4.4. The nephrology service was
consulted and upon evaluation of her labs felt this was
consistent with ATN. Witholding lasix and gentle diuresis, the
patient's renal function improved. Her medications were renally
dosed and nephrotoxins avoided where possible. Urine output
improved and creatinine trended down to 2.5 prior to discharge
to rehabilitation.

.
5) Crohn's Disease: Initially the patient was continued on
prednisone 18mg daily as per her home regimen. However with
hypotension and respiratory failure, she was started on stress
dose regimen which was eventually tapered. She was switched from
IV to po prednisone and is currently on a long taper. As above,
she has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3708**] as an outpatient. She will
continue on prednisone, mesalamine and cipro twice daily to
prevent a flare.

.
6) MDS and Related Anemia: The patient is known to have chronic
anemia secondary to both MDS and CKD. She is followed as an
outpatient by hematology and received weekly Epogen treatment
prior to her multiple admission. She was transfused several
times  for hematocrit of 25. Prior to discharge she was also
given a one-time dose of 10,000U Epogen (slightly hypertensive
at the time, did not give full 40,000U dose). She has follow-up
with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic to evaluate whether she should be
restarted on her Epogen treatments.

.
7) DVT/PE: Patient had chronic DVT/PE in the past for which she
was on lovenox, which was initially continued. In the setting of
acute renal failure she was switched to heparin for
approximately 2 days at which point her thrombocytopenia became
significantly worse (plt 49 at lowest). HIT antibodies were sent
and were negative. She was also found to have guaiac + stools
and tarry loose stools at times. Given her risk of bleeding
(anemia, thrombocytopenia) it was felt the risk of
anticoagulation was greater than the benefit, despite her
underlying PE/DVT history. The issue of anticoagulation should
be readdressed once her more pressing issues, namely
intermittent bloody stools and thrombocytopenia are resolved.
Lovenox was not restarted prior to discharge. Pneumoboot was
applied to the left arm once her skin and edema had healed.
Given her extensive upper extremity swelling of the L arm, an
upper extremity US was done to r/o DVT which was negative. Of
note, a thyroid cyst was identified on this study, which it
appears has been seen on prior imaging but should be further
evaluated if concerns arise in the future.

.
8) Hemorrhagic bullae s/p rupture: Much of this is likely due to
her years of steroid use. She has a variety of wounds from a
recent hospitalizations. Both wound care consult and vascular
surgery were asked to comment and felt surgical intervention or
debridement were not warranted, but good wound care and close
monitoring should be instituted. The patients legs were wrapped
daily, adaptec applied to wounds, and lotion applied to decrease
the risk of further skin tears. With time the swelling in her
arms and legs decreased, however her skin is very delicate and
good wound care practices need to be followed.

.
9) GERD: In the setting of guaiac positive stools she was
switched from omeprazole to protonix IV for two days while
concern for active bleed was ruled out. Once stable, she was
restarted on omeprazole 20mg twice daily.
.

10) Osteoporosis: Calcium and vitamin D were continued during
admission.

.
11) Nutrition: The patient has very poor appetite. She was NPO
for several days, and when she would eat, her diarrhea would
recur. Her diet was switched to lactose free and high calorie
supplements were provided.
.

12) Code: the patient's daughter and health care proxy confirmed
code as DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for diarrhea and pneumonia.
You were found to be hypotensive (low blood pressure) and have
respiratory failure which required you to be admitted to the
ICU. You were treated with IV fluids and antibiotics. You
completed a two week course of antibiotics for your pneumonia.
For your diarrhea you were given pulse dose steroids and are now
on a taper of prednisone. Since you had bowel movements that
were positive for blood (guaiac positive) and your platelet
count became very low, your anticoagulation was stopped. Your
lasix was initially held as you were found to be in renal
failure, which is now resolving. Please make sure to discuss
with your doctor when it is appropriate for you to restart your
metoprolol and lovenox.

The following changes were made to your medications:
Your lovenox has been stopped.
Your metoprolol is being held- speak to your doctor to determine
when it is ok to restart this medication.
Calcium, vitamin D have been added to your regimen.

If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pains,
abdominal pains, fevers or chills, or any other concerning
symptoms please call your doctor or return to the emergency
room.
