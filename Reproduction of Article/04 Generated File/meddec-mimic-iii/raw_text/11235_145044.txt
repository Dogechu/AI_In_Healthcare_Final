Chief Complaint:
fever to 103 degress, chills, fatigue, vomiting x 1 day

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 39 year old man with AIDS, CD4 of 4 in [**4-29**], VL not done,
who presented to the ED with 1 day of fevers to 103 degrees at
home, rigors and chills. On day of admission, he also had 1
episode of nausea, vomited up food (non-bilious/ non-bloody)
that has resolved. Pt. notes chronic cough he associated with
his thrush. Also had episode of diarrhea 5 days ago that
resolved. Otherwise, the patient denies headache, visual
changes, neck pain/stiffness, confusion, chest pain, SOB,
pleuritic CP, abdominal pain (has chronic tenderness
epigastrically), urinary changes, new rash or joint pain.
.
On arrival to the ED he was found to have a temperature of 102.9
degrees, HR in 130s, SBP 106/61. Also was found to have a
lactate of 7.7, bicarb of 15 (normally in 20s), ARF with cr of
2.5 (baseline 1.1-1.4). He was put on the MUST protocol and a
left subclavian line was placed. His initial CVP was 4. Mixed
venous sat was 85%. Blood cultures were drawn which grew [**2-28**]
bottles gram negative rods. He received doses of vanc/levo. His
BP dropped to 70/30, and he received 5 L of NS, levophed started
after 3 L and SBP 85. A-line placed - ABG - 7.40/26/137, and the
lactate improved to 1.5. He started making urine with up to 60
cc per hour. He was admitted to the MICU.

He was continued on the sepsis protocol in the MICU and
transfused with 2 units of blood for a HCT of 18. He was weaned
from levophedrine around 4 am and has since had a stable BP in
the 110's.

Patient was then transferred to floor on [**12-20**], at that time he
reported feeling much improved, but not quite at his baseline.
He denies continued fevers or chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, or other concerns. He says he is currently
almost blind from the CMV retinitis, and [**Doctor Last Name **] detect some light
in his left eye.

to postprandial state.

nephropathy.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.






Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 39 year old man with HIV CD4 4 in [**4-30**] with GNR bacteremia
and fever.

1) Presumed line infection - Patient had gram negative
bacteremia, Kelbsiella ocitoca  sensitive to levo in [**2-28**] blood
cultures. Follow up blood cultures negative. Most likely source
is the patient's port-o-cath though it is not clinically
infected. ID consulted and made recommendation to remove port.
The patient was evaluated by surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who states
that if the line is taken out, it would be next to impossible to
place another port-o-cath in.  In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**]
and the patient the decision is made to attempt to treat though
the line with a 14 day course of levofloxacin and monitor for
signs of infection.
Of not a cxray showed a RML diffuse infiltrate. Sputum showed 4+
year and normal oral flora. GI stool cultures were negative to
date. CMV viral load is pending at time of discharge. Also,
urine was positive for enterococcus sensitive to levo.

2) [**Name (NI) 6116**] - Pt. has baseline transaminase elevation, but
alk phos has increased from 200s in [**3-31**] to > 400. GGT elevated
to 497 but down from past results. RUQ showed contracted gall
bladder and small amount of ascitis.

3) acute on chronic renal failure - Possibly related to sepsis
vs med related or HIV nephropathy. Baseline Cr 1.5 in [**5-31**], now
elevated to 2.5. Renal U/S showed no hydro but enlarged kindeys
consistent with HIV nephropathy. No casts were noted. FENa was
4.4 without diuretics, which suggests that it is most likely HIV
nephropathy at new baseline . Creatinine improved to 1.6 on
dicharge.  Patient will follow up with renal as outpatient.

4) hisstory of hypotension, resolved - Patient was admitted on
the MUST protocol: in the ICU, his CVP was kept [**10-8**] with 1 L
IVF boluses, UO > 30 cc/ hr with prn 1 L IVF boluses; monitor
SVO2, random cortison was normal. He was weaned off levophed
after a few hours. His hypovolemia may have been partially due
to hypovolemia and parially due to sepsis.
.
5) anemia - Patient withchronic anemia, likely related to bone
marrow suppression from HIV or related meds. He has required
transfusions in the past and had 2 units in-house.
.
6) HIV - HAART therapy was discontinued during hospitalization
it will be restarted as outpatient. In house patient was
maintained on clarithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis, and dapsone
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  Patient was maintained on clindamycin and
pyrimethamine for history of toxoplasmosis. Patient maintained
on clotrimazole troche for thrush.  Patient placed on
Posaconazole (study drug) QID for refractory oral thrush.
.
4) CMV retinitis - On discharge the decision was made to hold
foscarnet therapy until patient's creatinine remains stable.
The plan is to continue foscarnet as maintenance therapy (rather
than treatment therapy as patient has already suffered visual
loss from the disease.)  The treatment plan is to prevent
extrocular manifestations of CMV.
.
5) prophylaxis - Patient maintained on PPI, heparin sq and
colace.
.
6) Access - During hospitalization a L subclavian placed [**12-19**],
patient will be discharged with portacath.
.
7) FEN - normal diet, boost TID
.
8) code - full code - Of note, patient says "short course of
intubation" acceptable and plans to discuss with his partner.

9) Dispo - Home with services.  Of note, patient receives
approximately 6 hours of VNA services (from 10:00-4:30)  Patient
reported sometimes being alone from 4:30-8:00 p.m. until his
partner came home for which he requested some companionship,
especially given his recent blindness.  However, the patient did
not feel unsafe during these time. We will discharge the patient
with his current services in place and attempt to find
additional support through community assistance and
care-for-the-blind programs. We also make recommendations
through his VNA to provide additional support for education for
the blind.
