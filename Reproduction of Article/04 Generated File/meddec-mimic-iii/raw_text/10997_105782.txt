ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 110983**] is a generally
healthy 68-year-old male who had been noticing some
increasing symptoms of palpitations and shortness of breath.
He was found on echocardiogram to have [**1-29**]+ mitral
regurgitation and was admitted electively for mitral valve
repair/replacement. His transesophageal echocardiogram at the
start of the procedure noted myxomatous degeneration of both
the anterior and posterior leaflets and prolapse at both
leaflets necessitating replacement of the valve.

His preoperative physical examination was notable for a mild
systolic murmur, but his lungs were otherwise clear. Abdomen
was soft. Pulse exam was within normal limits, and he had no
peripheral edema.

His preoperative labs include a hematocrit of 38.3, and BUN
and creatinine of 16 and 0.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2139-4-20**], and
on that same day underwent a minimally invasive mitral valve
replacement with a 33-mm mosaic porcine valve.
Intraoperatively, the patient experienced some atrial
fibrillation and a maze procedure was performed. Patient
tolerated the procedure well, and was taken to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit postoperatively.

He was extubated on postoperative day 0. His hospital course
was relatively unremarkable. He did quite well aside from
requirement for Neo-Synephrine to maintain his mean arterial
blood pressure above 60 for 2 days. His hypotension was fully
evaluated, not felt to be secondary to any sort of
cardiogenic etiology or secondary to hypovolemia, and as
noted by postoperative day 2, he was able to wean off the Neo-
Synephrine without any adverse effect on his blood pressure.

He was otherwise, as noted, extubated on postoperative day 0.
His chest tubes were removed on postoperative day 2 without
incident, and the patient was transferred to the regular
floor on postoperative day 2. He did require diuresis with
Lasix postoperatively for a 9 kilogram weight differential
from his preoperative and postoperative weight. He otherwise
remained afebrile and hemodynamically normal throughout the
rest of hospitalization. He was started on amiodarone and
Coumadin on postoperative day 3 for his atrial fibrillation
and without incident. He remained in sinus rhythm throughout
the rest of his hospitalization.

It is felt that by postoperative day 4, as the patient had
been afebrile, hemodynamically normal with oxygen saturations
in the high 90s and on room air, that he can be discharged to
home safely. At the time of his discharge, the patient's
lungs were slightly decreased at the bases, but otherwise
clear. His heart was regular in sinus rhythm, and he had
about a 1+ peripheral edema.

His labs were notable for a hematocrit of 27.4 and a BUN and
creatinine of 15 and 0.8. His final x-ray prior to discharge
was just notable for a little atelectasis at the bases, but
otherwise unremarkable.

He was sent home on the following medications: Lopressor 12.5
mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 10 days,
potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for 10 days, Zantac 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 2 weeks, aspirin 81 mg once a day, Colace
as needed, Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets every 4-6 hours
as needed, amiodarone taper starting 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. to
complete a 1 week course, followed by 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
1 week, followed by 400 mg once a day for 1 week, followed by
200 mg once daily or as adjusted by his cardiologist.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was advised to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
clinic in 4 weeks. He was also advised to followup with Dr.
[**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the electrophysiology service for
management of his atrial fibrillation as he had seen Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] preoperatively. Patient was unsure about this and
felt he may wanted another cardiologist, the name of which he
would let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] office know. He was also advised
to followup with his primary care physician within the next 7-
10 days.
