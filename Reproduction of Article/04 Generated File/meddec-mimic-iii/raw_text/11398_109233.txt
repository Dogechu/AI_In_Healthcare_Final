ID:  Baby Girl ([**Known lastname **]) [**Known lastname 64032**] is a 9 day old term infant with
Trisomy 21 and resolving primary pulmonary hypertension who is
being transferred from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU to the [**Hospital3 **]
SCN.

HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 64032**] is a former 3.545 product of a 41
week gestation pregnancy born to a 36 year-old gravida II,
para II-I woman whose pregnancy was apparently complicated
only by an elevated triple screen. Amnio declined. Antenatal
ultrasound said to be normal but full report not available at
time of delivery.

Prenatal screens complete and unremarkable. B negative,
antibody negative, hepatitis B surface negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS negative. No sepsis risk
factors noted.

Delivery by cesarean section on [**6-3**] at approximately 6
P.M. Did well at delivery. Apgars of 7 at one minute, 8 at
five minutes. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit team called at
about 10 minutes of age for grunting, flaring and retracting.
This quickly resolved. On examination at that time normal
cardiac examination and lung examinations. Tone slightly
decreased throughout. Nipples not hypoplastic. No brush
filled spots. Occiput not flattened. Subsequently went to
newborn nursery. At approximately 6 hours of age the patient
was noted to have cyanotic episodes. Seen by the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit team and was desaturating on room.
Brought to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit with blow-by O2
and saturations in the high 70s noted. No respiratory
distress noted. Placed on continuous positive airway pressure
with 100% O2 and had a slow increase from the 80s to the 90s.

EXAMINATION:  Pink active infant with vigorous cry. Skin
without lesions. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat with thin
upper lip, somewhat prominent tongue. Eyes with slightly
downward slant. Occiput normal. Cor normal, S1, S2 without
murmur. Precordium normally active. Four extremity blood
pressure without gradient. Lungs clear with fair aeration.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, no masses. Toes normally spaced.
No simian creases. Axial tone slightly decreased.
Appendicular tone normal. Neurologic otherwise normal. Spine
intact. Hips normal. Anus patent.

Initial post ductal pO2 difficult to obtain; pre-ductal arterial
puncture on 100% O2 showed pH of 7.24, CO2 of 46, pO2 of 37 and
repeat arterial blood gas from umbilical arterial line showed pH
of 7.33, CO2 38, pO2 69, 21-5. Chest x-ray shows relatively clear
lung fields, heart size slightly increased, RA prominent, TBF
normal to slightly decreased. Electrocardiogram normal for age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

RESPIRATORY: Baby was placed on continuous positive airway
pressure of 6 cm requiring 85 to 100% O2.  ECHO revealed
pulmonary hypertension. Oxygen therapy was continued, and infant
exhibited gradual improvement.  She initially remained on CPAP
and then was transitioned to oxygen [**Doctor Last Name **] by day of life 2. Oxygen
requirement gradually weaned from 100% to 30%, and she then
transitioned to a nasal cannula O2 on day of life 3, [**12-17**] liter
100% O2 with saturations greater than 98. Arterial gas on nasal
cannula O2 pH 7.36, pCO2 of 40, pO2 104, 24-2.  Nasal cannula
requirement weaned over next several days, but then plateaued at
25-50 cc.  By the time of transfer, the infant has had several
period in room air, but is mostly in nasal cannula oxygen, 25 cc.
Bilateral breath sounds are clear and equal. Baseline respiratory
rate 30s to 50s.  No apnea has been noted.  Of note, initial CXR
did suggest a small left pneumothorax, which resolved on
subsequent films.

CARDIAC: On [**6-4**] echocardiogram was performed because of
concern for cardiac anomaly. This showed right ventricular
hypertension, right ventricular dilatation with moderate
right ventricular dysfunction, normal left ventricular size
and systolic flow, patent foramen ovale, bidirectional low
velocity flow across the patent ductus arteriosus consistent
with systemic pulmonary arterial pressure.  Overall findings
were consistent with primary pulmonary hypertension.

Baby has had no murmur. Baseline heart rate 90 to 120s.
Recent blood pressure 80/53 with the mean in the 60s. Baby
did not require any pressor support and is currently
cardiovascularly stable. Of note, on initial admission did
reveal one normal saline bolus for poor perfusion.

FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient initially had
breast-fed and newborn nursery was made n.p.o. upon admission
to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, was started on
maintenance IV fluid at 60 ml per kilo per day of D10W and
ultimately transitioned to receive some parenteral nutrition
intravenously. She had a double lumen UVC line inserted and
an umbilical arterial line to monitor blood pressures. Her
umbilical arterial line was discontinued on day of life 2 as
her respiratory and cardiovascular condition stabilized. Her
double lumen UVC line was removed on day of life 3. Enteral
feedings were introduced on day of life 3. She advanced to
full enteral feedings of breast milk or Enfamil 20 ad lib
without incident. She is currently taking in greater than 120
ml per kilo per day. She is voiding and stooling, has had no
gastrointestinal issues.

Of note, she had a peripheral IV infiltrate in her right
hand. This has been followed by the plastic surgery team from
the [**Hospital3 1810**]. Digits are warm and well perfused.
The skin over the right dorsal hand has had areas of
sloughing. There has been some expected epidermolysis.
Plastic surgery anticipates there may be some full thickness
skin loss but from spontaneous activity appears to have
normal extension and flexion and a good strong grasp.
Currently xeroform and Telfa dressings are applied with dry
sterile dressing. There is no evidence of infection. The eschar
is servicing as a biological dressing for now and plan is for
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5385**] to follow up with the family in one to two weeks
after discharge. Family has met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5385**] in his office
and his phone number si [**0-0-**].

Last electrolytes on [**6-6**]: Sodium 140, potassium 3.7,
chloride 106, CO2 was QNS'd. Previous electrolytes on [**6-5**]: 144, 3.1, 110, 26.

Admission birth weight 3545 grams, 7 pounds, 13 ounces,
admission length 19 inches or 48 cm. Admission head
circumference 34 cm. Discharge weight 3600 grams.

GASTROINTESTINAL: On day of life 1 there was some
abdominal distention noted. Initial KUB showed some suggestion of
pneumatosis, but subsequent films were within normal limits, and
exam normalized rapidly. Bilirubin on day of life 2: 2.0, 0.4,
1.9. No photo therapy has been indicated.

HEMATOLOGY: The baby has not required any blood products
during this admission. Initial admission hematocrit was 51.7.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: On admission the baby had a sepsis
evaluation done. Had a white count of 13.1, 71 polys, 9
bands, 10 lymphs, 3 metas, platelet count of 219 and
hematocrit of 51.7. She was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin. Blood cultures remained negative. The baby was
improved at 48 hours and antibiotics were discontinued.

GENETICS: Because of subtle features consistent with trisomy-
21 chromosomes were sent and were positive for trisomy-21.
Parents were informed of this diagnosis on [**6-6**] and are
appropriately coping with the diagnosis. They have been
referred to the Downs Program at the [**Hospital3 1810**].
They have declined contact at this time and plan is for
[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to contact the family some time next week at
their home. The telephone number of the Downs Program is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64033**].

Parents have also been working with the occupational
therapist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38698**]. She can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41276**].
They will be followed by early intervention after discharge
and area aware that referral will occur prior to discharge.

NEUROLOGY: On examination baby is slightly hypotonic
consistent with trisomy-21.

SENSORY: Audiology screening has not been performed at time
of transfer. Ophthalmology: Eye examination has not been
performed.

PSYCHOSOCIAL: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is the social worker who has been
working with this family. She can be reached by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64034**] and having her paged if there are any additional
