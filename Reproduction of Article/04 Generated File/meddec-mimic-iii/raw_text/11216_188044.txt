HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male
status post coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**2134-4-16**], who is also recently status post kidney transplant in
[**2133-12-17**], who presented with purulent drainage from
his midsternal incision.  The patient had been admitted on
[**2134-4-2**], for increasing drainage from the sternal wound,
and on [**2134-4-6**], had undergone sternal rewiring.  He had
been treated with intravenous and ciprofloxacin and
discharged to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics.
He had remained stable and afebrile postoperatively with a
stable sternum.  However, he was seen by his physician on
[**2134-5-17**], who noticed blistering at the inferior aspect
of his wound and started him on Neosporin ointment and
dressing changes t.i.d.   The patient noticed increasing
drainage on [**5-18**] which was purulent then changed to
blood-streaked.  He had remained afebrile throughout the
entire period.  He had also noticed a postoperative cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's vital signs
were temperature of 98.1, heart rate 95, blood pressure
147/66, respiratory rate 18, satting 95% on room air.  The
patient's appearance revealed a well-appearing male, alert
and oriented times four, in no apparent distress.  Neurologic
examination was grossly intact.  Cardiovascular revealed a
regular rate and rhythm, sinus.  No murmurs.  His lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, warm, with 1+
pulses.  Saphenous vein graft site was healing well.  No
drainage, erythema or induration.  His sternum was stable
with wound mostly healed except for purulent to bloody
discharge from the base with a sinus tract superiorly and an
area of erythema of about 2 cm X 2 cm.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12,
hemoglobin 9.2, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 235.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.3, chloride 96, bicarbonate 23, BUN 32,
creatinine 1.8, glucose 216.  AST 19, albumin 3.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted with a diagnosis
of recurrent sternal wound infection with possible sternal
osteomyelitis.  He was started on intravenous vancomycin and
ceftriaxone.  Renal and Infectious Disease consultations were
obtained at that time.

He was taken to the operating room on [**2134-5-24**], where he
underwent sternal debridement.  The wound was left open, and
on [**2134-5-27**], the patient underwent partial sternotomy,
debridement of skin subcutaneous tissue and bone, removal of
hardware from sternum, omental flap to sternum, and bilateral
musculocutaneous advancement flap, and closure of his open
sternal wound under general anesthesia.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was then sent to the Intensive Care Unit
in stable condition.

His initial cultures grew out coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus as did cultures from his operating room
specimen.  The patient had a temperature spike
postoperatively to 101.  However, subsequent blood and urine
cultures were negative.  He was continued on vancomycin and
ceftriaxone postoperatively.

The patient remained intubated after his initial debridement
and was eventually extubated on [**5-29**].  He tolerated
extubation well.  He was transferred to the regular floor on
postoperative day seven and four and had an unremarkable
postoperative recovery.  He remained afebrile, tolerating a
regular diet, and ambulating independently.

He continued to be followed by the Renal Transplant Service.
He was restarted on his CellCept.

From an infectious standpoint, the patient continued to be
afebrile.  His ceftriaxone was stopped on day 10 due to low
suspicion for sternal osteomyelitis.  He was continued on the
intravenous vancomycin which he was to continue on for two
weeks postoperatively.  Due to the fact that the patient is a
renal transplant recipient he will be dosed by vancomycin and
levels checked randomly every two to three days.  The patient
also had bilateral [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains which had been
draining serosanguineous fluid.  He was on levofloxacin which
he was to continue on until the drains are removed.

Postoperatively, the patient also had some swallowing
difficulties and was placed on nectar-thick liquids for two
days; however, he recovered normal function and was able to
take a normal diet.

discharge, afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, and
ambulating independently.
