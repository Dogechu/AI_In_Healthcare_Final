Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20692**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-4-2**] for surgical
management of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A cardiac
catheterization and echocardiogram was performed in prepartion

five days. On [**2188-4-3**], he was taken to the operating room where
he underwent bilateral mini thoracotomies with a MAZE procedure
and left atrial appendage ligation. Postoperatively he was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. By
postoperative day one, he was extubated and neurologically
intact. He was then transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. Amiodarone and coumadin were restarted.

On POD#2, he was cleared by physical therapy to go home. His
subcutaneous pain medication pumps were discontinued. He felt
