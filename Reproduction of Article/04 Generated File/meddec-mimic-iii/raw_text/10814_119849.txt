Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Bacteremia/ Bleeding from G tube site


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy x3: Performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2163-11-7**] and
[**2163-11-8**]


History of Present Illness:
84 year old male per omr with history of CAD s/p stenting, CHF
(EF 55%), Afib, prior cardiac arrest and heart block s/p
pacer/AICD placement, chronic trach, and recent MRSA bacteremia
transitioned from vancomycin to daptomycin presenting from rehab
facility with continued bacteremia and bleeding around G-tube
site.
.
Briefly patient was doing well until [**6-/2162**] when he suffered a
fall that caused multiple fractures. He was hospitalized and
intubated and subsequently trached. He was transferred to rehab
where he spent a good deal of time with multiple readmissions
for various infections and chronic GI Bleeds. In [**2153-8-15**] was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have MRSa bacteremia. Was
dicharged on Vancomycin. Was readmitted later that month for a
GI bleed. EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] was deferred [**2-16**] to family wishes and
comorbidites. He was discharged again to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Surveilece cultures remained positive and he was readmitted for
infectious work up. TTE, TEE and tagged WBC scan were all
negative for ocult infectious source. On that admission he was
diagnosed with concurrent Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI and
treated with Meropenam. Given his persistent MRSA bacteremia he
was switched from Vancomycin to daptomycin.
.
Over the last several days he has been febrile with intermittent
AMS. Blood cultures are persistently positive. Per notes form
his PCP and discussions with the family, he is being admitted
for evaluation for ICD lead explantation and for managment of
fevers.
.
With regards to the bleedign at the G-tube site, the nursing
staff at the rehabilitation facility noted oozing of blood from
around the G-tube site. There was no bleeding at the lumen of
the site. The patient remained normotensive. He remained normal
mental status. The G-tube was clear and patent. There were no
exacerbating or relieving factors. There was no known preceding
trauma to the G-tube.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  88 130/70   99% 15L
.
FAST positive but hemodynamic stable
CT abd non-con: simple fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, but no
evidence for hematoma. left ventral wall hernia containing
non-obstructed loops of bowel.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was alert and cooperative and
following commands.

CT ABDDOMEN AND PELVIS Study Date of [**2163-11-4**] 5:01 PM
MPRESSION:
.
1. Diffuse anasarca with small to moderate amount of ascites
within the abdomen and pelvis, but no evidence for hemorrhage.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions which have increased
since the most recent examination. Small pericardial effusion,
increased.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
4. Parastomal hernia containing nonobstructed, nondilated loops
of small bowel.
5. Prostatic hypertrophy.
6. 15-mm hyperdense left upper pole renal lesion which is
unchanged and may represent a hemorrhagic cyst. This can be
further assessed with MRI if clinically indicated (as prior
renal ultrasound from [**2163-9-5**] did not demonstrate any
abnormality within this area).
.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

a.m.:

Tip of the new right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. There
is no change
in the small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and no
pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening to suggest complications of line insertion.
Severe
cardiomegaly is longstanding. Pulmonary vascular engorgement and
bibasilar
atelectasis are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is midline.
Transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in
their expected
locations, unchanged. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 YOM with MMP most notable of which inclue persistent MRSA
bacteremia of unknown source, recurrent MDR UTI's, PNA, chronic
renal failure presented with fevers, MRSA bacteremia, UTI and
UGIB.
.
# Brief Hospital course: Patient was initially admitted for
infectious w/u due to fevers, and was found to have MRSA
bacteremia (chronic, likely [**2-16**] seeding of ICD), and
Klebsiella/Pseudomonas UTI.  These were treated with IV
vancomycin and meropenem.  He subsequently developed bleeding at
his G-tube site as well as increased dark output from ostomy
bag.  His hct trend was: 30 ([**11-4**]) -> 28 ([**11-5**]) -> 25 ([**11-5**])
-> 22 ([**11-6**]).  He was transfused 1 unit pRBC.  Hct [**11-7**] was 18
and bleeding persisted.  GI and surgery were consulted.  He was
given reglan, and started on ppi iv bid.  GI performed 3 EGDs
that large amounts of blood and an ulcer with visible vessel
around peg insertion site; An initial attempt at clipping the
ulcer caused bright red blood, confirming that this was likely
the cause of the patient's recent bleed. 10cc of epinephrine
were injected around the ulcer. 2 clips were applied around the
ulcer with hemostasis successfully achieved. The PEG was
removed.  Because of his chronic MRSA bacteremia (thought likely
[**2-16**] ICD seeding), TPN was not an option and family felt that a
feeding tube would cause him too much discomfort.  The
palliative care team was consulted for assistance with the
family's decision-making regarding goals of care.  The family
ultimately felt that his current quality of life was not
consistent with what he would have wanted based on remarks he
had made in the past.  They elected to change his goals of care
to comfort-measures only.  On HD#9 he passed away with family at
bedside.  Family declined autopsy.
