84yo PMHx rectal cancer s/p resection and XRT w ostomy, systolic
CHF (LVEF40-45%), recent trach/peg who presented with

ACTIVE
# Healthcare Associated Pnuemonia and MRSA Bacteremia - Patient
presented with increasing O2 requirements, leukocytosis and
hypotension; CXR demonstrated LLL PNA; accompanying elevated
Lactate, High SvO2 (93%), hypotension and tachycardia suggested
sepsis; blood and sputum cultures grew out MRSA.  Patient was
initially fluid resuscitated and briefly required vasopressors.
He was treated with vancomycin (initially with cefepime and
levofloxacin as well, which were stopped based upon culture
data).  Patient respiratory status improved, and patient was
able to be weaned off vent to trach collar.  Given MRSA
bacteremia, patient had PICC line changed and underwent TTE that
did not demonstrate signs of valvular lesions; patient was
planned for 2 week course with IV vancomycin.
