Studies:

CXR [**2163-9-20**]: No significant change from [**2163-9-9**] radiograph, with
cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral
pleural effusions again noted.  Left lower lobe opacity is
compatible with atelectasis and/or pneumonia.

TTE [**2163-9-21**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study dated [**2163-9-8**] (images reviewed), the degree of
pulmonary pressures is much lower (likely underestimated as the
IVC was not well visualized). No vegetations or abscesses
visualized.

TEE [**2163-9-22**]: No vegetations seen on the cardiac leaflets. No mass
or vegetation seen on the cardiac wires. Simple atheroma aortic
arch. At least moderate in severity eccentric mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

BLE Ultrasound [**2163-9-24**]: Limited study demonstrates no evidence
of right or left lower extremity DVT.

CXR [**2163-9-25**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
position of the
tracheostomy tube and of the pacemaker wires is unchanged.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of
atelectasis and substantial enlargement of the vascular
structures at the lung hilus. Unchanged moderate pulmonary
edema. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.

WBC scan [**2163-9-26**]: 1. Splenomegaly. 2. No focal source of
infection localized.

Bilateral UE ultrasound [**2163-9-28**]: No evidence of upper extremity
deep venous thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] is a 84 year
old male with h/o CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%),
atrial fibrillation, h/o cardiac arrest with heart block s/p
AICD/pacemaker, trach/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI
bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab
with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin.

#. MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent
bacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood
cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite
appropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent
seeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both
negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his
pacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult
focus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity
ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot
but was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced
at [**Hospital **] rehab was removed. A new one was not placed until he
had negative blood cultures.  He was continued on vancomycin and
dosing was changed to 1g q48h.  Further blood cultures were
negative.   Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular
source but it was not found during this hospitalization.  He
should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date
of his last positive blood culture, with last day [**2163-11-2**].

#. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an
indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be
colonization however his cultures were positive even after
changing his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his
urine as well as wound culture.  It was multidrug resistant
pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day
course.  He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when
trough < 1.  He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his
urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last
day [**10-2**].

#. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his
MRSA bacteremia.  Other cultures returned positive as above.  He
also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with
septic arthritis.  His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line
holiday.  He was ruled out for C diff.

#. Acute renal failure: BUN/creatinine elevated to 70/1.7 on
admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor
forward floor from chronic systolic CHF.  His creatinine slowly
improved with diuresis.

#. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical
ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to
trach mask for any length of time.  This was felt to be related
to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial
pulmonary edema.  Diuresis was difficult due to his large
obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix
80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid.  His metolazone may
need to be decreased over the next several days if he is
overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen
for the few days prior to discharge.  On the day of discharge,
he was on pressure support [**12-19**], PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the
300's.

#. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during
this admission.

#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his
home carvedilol.  His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely
and was not restarted due to renal failure.  He was diuresed
with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his
creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing
diuresis.

#. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV.  He was started on a
fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control.

#. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure
remained stable during this admission.  He is off
anticoagulation due to h/o GI bleeding and hemothorax.  He was
continued on carvedilol.

#. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who
recommended the following:
1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid
management. Turn q 2 hours.
2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry.
3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft
sorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily.
4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and
wrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape.
5. No tape on skin.
6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days.
7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to
assist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with
Mepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days.
8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal
tissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to
assess with edema.
9. Waffles bilateral feet.
10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily.
11. Support nutrition and hydration.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Monitor I/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given
large doses of lasix and metolazone.  [**Month (only) 116**] need to back off on
metalazone if signs of overdiuresis.  However, would continue to
aim for -500cc daily I/O balance.
- Needs tobramycin trough drawn [**2163-10-1**] AM.  Give tobramycin
320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0.
- Continue vancomycin until [**2163-11-2**] for MRSA bacteremia.
Should have trough measured intermittently to assess for
appropriate dosing.
- Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment
- Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if
possible.  Diuresis should help with this.
- Please draw weekly labs: CBC/diff, chem-7, LFTs and fax to
Infectious disease R.Ns. at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1353**].  All questions
regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the
when clinic is closed
